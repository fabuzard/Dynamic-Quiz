# Dynamic Quiz App 🎉  

Hey there! I built this simple **Dynamic Quiz App** as a fun way to dive deeper into JavaScript and DOM manipulation. It’s got two quiz categories: **Game Quiz** and **Pop Culture Quiz**—so pick one and test your knowledge!

- Works well on mobile and desktop—because why not?  

## 🛠️ Why I Made This  

I wanted to practice and improve my skills with:  
- **HTML** for structure.  
- **CSS** for styling (keeping it simple).  
- **JavaScript** to handle all the quiz logic and make it interactive.  

This project was all about learning how to manipulate the DOM and build something cool at the same time.  

## 🎉 Hope You Enjoy  

Take the quiz, see how you do, and feel free to share any feedback or suggestions! 😊
